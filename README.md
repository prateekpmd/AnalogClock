# AnalogClock. An analog clock is a tool for reading the time of day. The shortest hand indicates the hour, a longer hand indicates the minutes, and the longest arm indicates the seconds. Some analog clocks have only two hands: the shorter hand indicating the hour and the longer hand indicating the minutes.
